# College ROI Predictor

Machine learning analysis exploring the relationship between college characteristics, major choice, and post-graduation financial outcomes.

## Project Overview
This project investigates which factors most significantly influence the return on investment of higher education decisions. Using Random Forest modeling on comprehensive federal education data, I analyze patterns across 500+ U.S. universities to understand what drives successful educational investments.

## Research Questions
- Which school characteristics (cost, selectivity, size, location) best predict graduate earnings?
- How does major choice interact with institutional factors to influence ROI?
- Can we identify undervalued educational opportunities in the market?
- What trade-offs exist between educational cost and long-term financial outcomes?

## Data Sources
- U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard API
- Bureau of Labor Statistics (economic indicators)

## Technical Approach
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest (scikit-learn)
- **Data Processing:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Status
In Development - Data collection phase
